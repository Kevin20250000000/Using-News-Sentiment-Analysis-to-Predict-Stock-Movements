# Using-News-Sentiment-Analysis-to-Predict-Stock-Movements

## Introduction

In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic images and videos, as well as transforming data across modalities. However, their application to stock price forecasting—a complex time series problem—remains an emerging area of research. The inherent volatility of stock markets and the significant influence of investor sentiment present unique challenges for accurate prediction.

Recent studies have begun to explore the integration of sentiment analysis into GAN-based models to enhance stock price prediction. For instance, the FB-GAN model combines historical stock data with sentiment scores derived from news articles using BERT, demonstrating improved predictive performance across major equities like Amazon and Apple . Similarly, sentiment-guided adversarial learning frameworks incorporate social media sentiment data, leading to more accurate forecasts compared to traditional models such as ARIMA and LSTM .

In this notebook, I develop a model to forecast Tesla (TSLA) stock prices by integrating historical data and technical indicators with external factors like trader sentiment and brand reputation, as reflected in social media posts. This comprehensive approach aims to capture the multifaceted dynamics of the market, potentially leading to more accurate and robust stock price predictions.

Stock price movements are influenced by more than just historical data; external factors like social media sentiment can have significant impacts. Notable examples include Elon Musk's tweets, which have been shown to cause substantial fluctuations in Tesla's stock price. For instance, in August 2018, Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private at 420𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒,𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡𝑜𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛614 billion drop in Tesla's market value .

Research indicates a significant relationship between Twitter sentiment and stock returns. Studies have found that peaks in Twitter activity and sentiment can lead to abnormal stock returns . This suggests that analyzing the tone of social media posts, particularly on platforms like Twitter, can provide valuable insights into market dynamics.

In this notebook, we will incorporate sentiment analysis of Twitter posts to assess the mood of stock market participants. By integrating this external indicator with traditional financial data, we aim to enhance the accuracy and robustness of stock price predictions.
